# simon-game
A recreation of the game Simon. A free code camp project.

I started this project just after expoloring the object literal design
pattern in my repo js-design-patterns, so I initially coded it the same way. I wanted to gain more familiarity with that pattern. I did, but 
when I was almost done I came to realize this would be a good canidate to try out
the MVC pattern. I converted my current work to the MCV pattern and it allowed
me to make a more reliable app with less code. Not to mention it was much more
orgainized! 

I wanted the user to be able cancel the playing sequence without repercussions
which presented a challange. I used promises along with timeout to make this possible.
Checkout the "play"  method in View.js. I also learned a ton about svg with this project!

Master Branch is the MVC pattern.
